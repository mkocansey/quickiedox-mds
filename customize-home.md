# Customize the Homepage

The default behaviour of QuickieDox is to load a home page with a button that leads to the main documentation page. Landing on the home page can be skipped by setting `SHOW_HOME_PAGE=false`{.inline} in your .env file. Users will be directed straight to the page youâ€™ve defined in the `DEFAULT_DOC_PAGE`{.inline} variable. 

The content of the home page can be found in `home.php`{.inline} at the root of the project. Simply edit this page to suit your design needs. 

You can change your theme colours by [following this]({version}/customize-tailwind).
