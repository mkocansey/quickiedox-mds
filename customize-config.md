# Customize Configurations

The variables defined in `.env`{.inline} and `config.php`{.inline} allow you to easily customize QuickieDox to suit you. The `config.php`{.inline} sets defaults for variables it is expecting to be defined in the `.env`{.inline} file. Below is a list of all the variables in both files and what they do.
