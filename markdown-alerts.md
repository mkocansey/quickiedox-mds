# Attention Grabbers

There are instances where you want to emphasize some points in your documentation but bold and italics are just not enough. 

QuickieDox comes with inbuilt helper css classes that turn block elements in your documentation to highlighted sections that grab the attention of your readers. We call these alerts. There are four types of alerts classes. Note, Tip, Okay and Stop. The difference between the various types of alerts is the colour of the element and the icon used. 

## Note
